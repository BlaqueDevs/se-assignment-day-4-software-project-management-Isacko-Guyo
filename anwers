Timely delivery ensures customer satisfaction, maintains project momentum, and avoids penalties. Project managers can use tools like Gantt charts, Agile methodologies, and effective communication to stay on track.
Effective cost control prevents budget overruns and ensures profitability. Strategies include detailed budgeting, resource optimization, and regular monitoring.
Agile is iterative, adaptable, and customer-focused, while Waterfall is linear and plan-driven. Agile is better for complex projects with changing requirements, while Waterfall suits well-defined projects with stable requirements.
Agile is suitable for complex projects with uncertain requirements (e.g., mobile apps, startups). Waterfall works well for smaller projects with clearly defined scope (e.g., building a basic website).
Quality assurance ensures the software meets user expectations and is free of defects. Methods include testing, code reviews, and quality standards.
Project scope defines the boundaries of the project. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) breaks down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, aiding in planning and resource allocation.
A detailed project schedule provides visibility, enables resource planning, and helps identify potential bottlenecks. Gantt charts visualize tasks, dependencies, and timelines.
